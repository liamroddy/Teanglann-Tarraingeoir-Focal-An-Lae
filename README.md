# Teanglann-Tarraingeoir-Focal-An-Lae

Extracts the "Word of the Day" from teanglann.ie

Teanglann does not have an API for getting the FaL so this script just pulls down the front page HTML doc and manually extracts the FaL and prints it in a human readable format.

I intend to use this script with this LED clock project: https://github.com/liamroddy/LED-Matrix-Clock

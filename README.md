# Teanglann-Tarraingeoir-Focal-An-Lae

A simple Python script that extracts the Focal An Lae ("Word of the Day") from teanglann.ie

Teanglann does not have an API for getting the FaL so this script just pulls down the front page HTML doc and manually extracts the FaL and prints it in a human readable format.

For an example usage see my LED clock project: https://github.com/liamroddy/LED-Matrix-Clock 

DISCLAIMER: I have zero affiliation with Teanglann or Foras na Gaeilge. I just like their word of the day and so cooked this up for a personal project.
If you use this please use it responsibly and at don't make too many requests - the word updates every night at midnight so max only request is needed per day.
